1. HitoBus aims to bring train-like predictability to bus transport — even in unpredictable and decentralized systems.

2. Instead of depending solely on GPS (which often fails or doesn’t exist), our system combines:

🔹 Authorized Data Sources
    -Government route permits
    -Official timetables

🔹 Crowd-Verified Signals (Opt-in & Anonymized)

🔹 Probabilistic bus position estimation

🔹 ETA prediction using historical delays and traffic behavior

🔹 Route deviation detection without fixed schedules

🔹 This hybrid approach allows reliable tracking even when live GPS is missing or unreliable.
