1. HitoBus aims to bring train-like predictability to bus transport — even in unpredictable and decentralized systems.

2. Instead of depending solely on GPS (which often fails or doesn’t exist), our system combines:

🔹 Authorized Data Sources

    -Government route permits

    -Official timetables

🔹 Crowd-Verified Signals (Opt-in & Anonymized)

  Probabilistic bus position estimation

  ETA prediction using historical delays and traffic behavior

  Route deviation detection without fixed schedules

  This hybrid approach allows reliable tracking even when live GPS is missing or unreliable.
