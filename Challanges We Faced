CHALLENGES WE FACED

-Unlike trains, buses operate in a highly decentralized ecosystem:
-Operated by state transport corporations, private contractors, and informal fleets
-No uniform mandate for GPS or data sharing
-Routes and schedules frequently change
-No centralized or standardized APIs
-As a result, passengers face:
-Long and uncertain waiting times
-Safety risks, especially for women, elderly, and late-night commuters
